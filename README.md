Roguelike1-curses
=================

An old 2012 project of mine, using pdcurses and C++ to try and make an ascii adventure game. It is riddled with poor planning, bad coding, but serves as an archive of ideas that I carried over into future projects. I may revisit and clean it up from time to time, It was one of my first "AHA" moments in game making.

Build and place exe into resources folder to run.
